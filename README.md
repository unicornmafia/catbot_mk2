# catbot_mk2


This is a simple robot that runs two servos and a laser for the purpose of entertaining cats.
I built it because I wanted to mess around with the RISC-V ESP32-C3, ESP-IDF, and FreeRTOS. 
And also because I wanted to entertain my cats.  And I'm too lazy to play with them all the time.

This is mk2 because the first time I did this, I did it in arduino with a regular ESP32.
